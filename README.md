TaskGuardian API is a powerful backend service designed to manage tasks, users, and projects for the TaskGuardian platform. This Node.js-based API provides endpoints for task management, user authentication, and other essential features required for efficient task handling and project tracking. It is built with modern web technologies and adheres to best practices for performance, security, and maintainability.

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure login, registration, and session management using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Task Management: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, projects, and user assignments.
- Project Organization: Create and manage projects, assign tasks to users, and track progress.
- Robust Error Handling: Centralized error handling for consistent responses.
- Database Connectivity: Built-in support for MongoDB using Mongoose, with automatic retries on failed database connections.
- Logging: Comprehensive logging using a custom logger for tracking API events, errors, and database connections.
- Rate Limiting & Security: API security is enhanced with request rate limiting and HTTP header protection (via Helmet).
- Modular Design: Clean and modular architecture with clear separation between routes, controllers, services, and utilities.
- Scheduled Task Retry: Utility to handle retries for failed tasks with countdown mechanisms.
